Welcome to the Amoral Sciences Club, the undergraduate philosophy club of Cambridge! We aim to provide a platform for philosophical discussions amongst Cambridge students. We also hope to be an avenue through which students interested in Philosophy can network and socialise. 

Most of [our meetings](https://www.amoralsciences.com/events "our meetings") are structured around a particular topic, such as the ethics of death, or the epistemology of disagreement. While we'll suggest some readings before each meeting, these are strictly optional. We aim for every meeting to be engaging to those with little to no background in the topic at hand, and of course, **non-philosophy students are most welcome** at the ASC.

We also provide undergraduates with opportunities to present their own philosophical research. Apart from academic meetings, we host more socially-oriented events every term. 

To join us, you simply need to fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/SDwbGMb5GQrUHd768 "this form"). You may also want to follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/amoralsciencesclub "Facebook").

See you around!
